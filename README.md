## Best Song Parts

`bsp` stands for *Best Song Parts*. It's a simple CLI tool working along with the [Music Player Daemon (MPD)](https://www.musicpd.org/).

### Purpose

When listening to music, there is sometimes a favourite moment in a song: a chorus, a guitar solo, an amazing variation, whatever. Something you love. A part of a song that you wish you could remember the position of so you could listen to it again at any time.

That's what `bsp` is all about: marking all the musical moments you like the most and playing them automatically. These time sliders are saved in an easy to edit, easy to share text file.

`bsp` tries to keep things as simple as possible and provide an enjoyable audio experience.
